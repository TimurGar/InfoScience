1. What did we do?

I read an article "How your personal computer can help science battle the coronavirus while you sleep"ã€€by John D'Anna for Arizona Republic Magazine.

Answered the questions.

2. What did you learn?

I learned that we can use our computers to find a ways to fight against COVID-19. You can dowload a program and while your are not your computer it can help scientists to find a ways to fight against COVID-19.

Online class no.1 
April 1 2020

1. What did we do?

I watched [e-learning] Video #1 and made a code in the end.

2. What did you learn?

That we can use abstraction in computer science to represent very complex things in a simple way. For example we know that every people are unique, they have different colors of eyes, height, weight, age, etc. But in our situation we know that this information is not important for us so can represent a human just as a circle. 

Code for the [e-learning] Video #1:

```.py
posX = 300
posY = 300

def setup():
    size(500,500)
    
def draw():
    global posX,posY
    background(255)
    strokeWeight(2)
    
    circle(posX, posY, 40) 
    posX = posX + random(-10,10)
    posY = posY + random(-10,10)
    
    if posX > 500:
        posX = 500
    if posX < 0:
        posX = 0
    if posY > 500:
        posY = 500
    if posY < 0:
        posY = 0
    
    delay(100)
```
3. Question that I have

Who can I test if my code is correct?

To check it, first, I commented out this two lines and a "delay(100)" command so that the circle(human) will not move randomly:
#posX = posX + random(-10,10)
#posY = posY + random(-10,10)

Then, instead of them I wrote this line:
posX = posX + 5
In this situation the circle(human) moved straight to the borther(right one) so that I would be able to check if it would stop when it will reach it.

Then, I deleted the previous line and I wrote this line:
posX = posX - 5
In this situation the circle(human) moved straight to the borther(left one) so that I would be able to check if it would stop when it will reach it.

Then, I deleted the previous line and I wrote this line:
posY = posY + 5
In this situation the circle(human) moved straight to the borther(Down one) so that I would be able to check if it would stop when it will reach it.

Then, I deleted the previous line and I wrote this line:
posY = posY - 5
In this situation the circle(human) moved straight to the borther(Up one) so that I would be able to check if it would stop when it will reach it.

After the test was done SUCCESSFULLY, I delete the previous line and agin paste this two lines and a "delay(100)" command: #posX = posX + random(-10,10)
#posY = posY + random(-10,10)

My second program

```.py
    Xlst = list()
    Ylst = list()
    Color = list()

    NumOfHumans = 40


    def setup():
        global Xlst,Ylst, NumOfHumans
        size(500,500)

        for i in range(NumOfHumans):
            ValX = int(random(50,450))
            Xlst.append(ValX)
            ValY = int(random(50,450))
            Ylst.append(ValY)

        print(Xlst)
        print(Ylst)  

    def draw():
        global Xlst,Ylst, NumOfHumans
        background(255)
        strokeWeight(2)

        for i in range(NumOfHumans):
            circle(Xlst[i], Ylst[i], 40) 
            Xlst[i] = Xlst[i] + random(-10,10)
            Ylst[i] = Ylst[i] + random(-10,10)

            if Xlst[i] > 500:
                Xlst[i] = 500
            if Xlst[i] < 0:
                Xlst[i] = 0
            if Ylst[i] > 500:
                Ylst[i] = 500
            if Ylst[i] < 0:
                Ylst[i] = 0

        delay(100)
```

Answering the questions:
What strategy is the most efficient to contain the spread of a virus in a general population?

The most efficient strategy in this situation is to declare a quarantine so that people are not able to go out of their homes, make a maximum distance for going out(may be up to 500 meters). Close the stores, except grocery stores and pharmacies.


In your opinion, should people enable access to the resources of their personal computers as tools for research? Are there any risks?

Of cource there is a risk, that people would be able to accept your personal data. But the advantages of using this type of method to find a way: 
    1. It can increase the speed of researching ways how to solve COVID-19.
    2. This program is optional, so if you afraid of it it is fine.
I think in this situation the risk is justified because everyone can probably safe a lot of lives without actually communicating with the affected.

What should be some behaviours (at least 3) that we will need to include in our simulation to be a realistic approximation of the current situation in the world? Explain.

    1. They should a wat from each other(a least 20px - may represent 2 meters) 
        Because now, people are trying to not come close to each other because they afraid to get a COVID-19.
    2. Stay in a groups of three people maximum.
        To again decrease the chance of getting COVID-19.
    3. Wear a masks to most of the people.
        To not spread the virus
    4. If a person doesn't have a mask, people will stay even futher(may be 75 px - 7.5 meters)
        Because almost everyone don't want to talk to a person who doesn't wear a mask.
    5. Add houses so that people will stay in it.
    
1. What did we do?

1)I watched videos about Enigma - a cipher machine that was using during WW2 and Caesar cipher
2)I decode the text that was writen in Caesar cipher
3)I modeled and 3D printed my cipher machine

2. What did you learn?
What is Enigma and why it was very hard to hack
What was the weakness of the Enigma
What is Caesar Cipher
How to decode a Caesar Cipher

3. Question that I have
What would happen if Enigma could change to original letter(e.g. A) to itself(A) in other words don't change it at all? 
How would this affect the outcome of the war?
